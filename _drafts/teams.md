# Teams

## Abstract

In this paper, we characterize teams as groups of at least three people
with complementary skills who are committed to a common purpose or
common performance goal and who complete their interdependent tasks
through collaboration. [katzenbach (2003)]
We discuss how teams can collaborate virtually, which challenges follow
from geographical dispersion of team members
and how they can be addressed and overcome.
Furthermore, we outline the feats that members should have in every team.
Lastly, we present a list of collaboration tools that enable teams
to work together both synchronously and asynchronously.
We conclude with some of our own experiences from the virtual work
on this project and our opinion about the future of collaboration:
What is considered extraordinary and challenging about virtual teams
nowadays might be considered normal in the not-too-distant future.


## Definition of a Team

Both throughout the course of our studies and in this lecture we have
heard of various attempts at the definition of a team:
[katzenbach (2003), MIT (2007), Hoelzle (2012)].

For ourselves, we focus the definition on
the following three aspects of a team:

1. A team is composed of at least 3 individuals.<br>
  2 people do not form a team since it is not possible for them to partake
  in the same rich interactions that arise in a larger group of people
  (e.g alliance formation).

2. A team works towards some a common purpose or a common performance goal.<br>
  Ideally, the team members commit to a shared vision of what they
  want to achieve and hold themselves mutually accountable for the work
  towards this goal.

3. Teams can be differentiated from "simple" groups of people
  through the interdependent nature of their work.<br>
  In teams, responsibility is shared between members on tasks that require
  collaboration.
  Ideally, individual skills can be coordinated so that members are able
  to maximize their strengths and minimize their weaknesses.


## Virtual Teams

In today's age of flourishing globalization teams are faced with new challenges.
One especially important is the geographical dispersion of its members.
These teams - working across temporal, spatial and maybe also across
organizational boundaries - are called virtual teams.
Typically they are composed of highly cross-functional members from
various ethical and cultural backgrounds working on highly interdependent tasks.
The existence of these teams is enabled solely by the use of
information technology and in particular communication technology.

The challenges these teams face are not only those imposed by their goals,
but also the management of the virtual interaction.
On top of the task-related processes such as communication and coordination
- also socio-emotional processes like relationship building - team cohesion
and establishment of mutual trust need to be taken into consideration.
[Powell Piccoli Ives (2004)]

Additional strain on the interaction can arise from cultural differences
and language barriers.


### Software Development Teams

Another type of team to be mentioned is the software development team.
It relates to a virtual team insofar, that its day-to-day work includes a lot
of the technological tools a virtual team uses.
In fact software development teams created most of the technologie other teams
are adopting nowadays.
Like in virtual teams, a lot of collaboration in software development
happens asynchronously.
Apart from that, software teams are highly specialized teams.
Required roles like Architect, Database Administrator, Designer, Programmer,
Requirements Analyst, etc. are usually assigned to individual team members.
[Ambler (2000)]


### Special conditions

The dissimilarities of the team members – be it by location, by culture etc. –
impose the need for special support by the team leader.
We will now explain some of the problems and possible solutions:

1. Team members need to be aware that they are working in a virtual team.
  If they do not keep this premise in mind at all times the team will
  perform worse than both a co-located team and the
  average virtual team. [Ferrazzi (2012)]

2. Geographical distribution

  1. The fact that team members might be located in different time
    zones makes planning of virtual meetings or conferences at
    convenient times difficult. One or more team members might have
    to work at an inconvenient time and not be capable of performing
    to their full extent. This problem can either be worked around
    or even used to the team's benefit.

    1. Plan the meetings at different times so that each team
      member at least once has the convenience to work normally
      and the inconvenience to work long hours.

    2. Members who are scattered all over the world can work on a
      "follow-the-sun" schedule. Whenever a member goes to bed he
      leaves a to-do list for the next who gets up, who can then
      start working on these tasks. Thus, the work on the project
      is never halted.

  2. Due to the possibly scattered locations meeting the team members
    in person can be difficult for reasons of cost and
    time-effectiveness. If the duration of the project is long
    enough the effort will most certainly have positive effects and
    make up for the initial investment by boosting the team's spirit
    and performance. See 'The kick-off meeting'.

3.  Cultural differences

  1. Social habits<br>
    In different cultures there are different ways of beginning and
    leading a conversation. Americans often use the set phrase "How
    are you?" upon which Germans tend to answer with their actual
    situation. The other way around the American might be offended
    by the German not asking for his well-being. Although these are
    only very small issues they can - in sum - lead to tension among
    the team members and need to be taken care of beforehand.

  2. Way of discussing<br>
    Especially in the Arabic world it is common to discuss very
    hotly. However other cultures are usually not used to this
    behaviour and might easily misinterpret the way of discussion
    for aggression and therefore get angry themselves. The team
    manager must assure that either the temper of the one is
    restrained or the others are made aware to the fact that their
    counterpart is just discussing 'normally'.

4.  Language

  1. English as standard language<br>
    As it is the 'business language' being fluent in English is a
    requirement for working in an international team.

  2. Translations, idioms and "false friends"<br>
    If not all members can resort to a common language the lack of
    mutual understanding can lead to conflicts within the team.
    Another problem is idiomatic speech that is not known to
    everybody, especially if sayings are translated directly into
    English e.g. "Vom Regen in die Traufe" directly translates to
    "From rain to eaves" but rather corresponds to "from the frying
    pan into the fire".

5. Technical terms in different languages<br>
  It is a common thing to know the terms of one's field of expertise
  in English but less so with the vocabulary of other fields.
  Explaining the terms of software engineering to a designer can cost
  precious time. In such cases the team leader needs to assess the
  necessity of such explanations.


## The kick-off Meeting

The kick-off meeting is a face-to-face meeting at the
beginning of the work phase and helps to build the team's cohesion by
getting to know each other on a more personal level than it is possible
by means of virtual communication. In this meeting every team member
should introduce himself and the field he is working in. Telling a
personal story of one's own is also important in order to establish
social relations. Furthermore sharing the hopes and expectations for the
project helps building a common vision and mindset. At this opportunity
the team leader will set and explain guidelines for work practices like

1. Communication

  1. Internal<br>
    e.g. questions need to be answered within a certain time, team
    members are to be treated with respect at all times, report to
    the team leader if problems or conflicts arise

  2. External<br>
    e.g. spelling of the company name in a certain fashion, include
    a disclaimer in written communication

2. Documentation<br>
  e.g. put down all information that might be used for maintenance of
  the product or for further development in a project wiki.


## Feats of your Team Members

### Diversity

The team members can be diverse in many different ways. Apart from being
in different locations or speaking different languages they have
different skills and professional backgrounds. In order to profit from
this diversity all team members need to embrace the idea of being
different and dispel biases against other fields of expertise. As
Kathleen Eisenhardt points out that two engineers make the worst team.
Through diverse views on things more options are available from which to
choose the best suited one. [Eisenhardt].


### Communication

Communication is another key aspect of members working efficiently in a
team. In general teams of introverts who tend to communicate less
produce worse results than teams of extroverts. Through extensive
communication among the team members they will create more cohesion,
work more coordinately and perform better. Thorough communication about
more personal topics helps to build relationships between the members of
a team. If two persons dislike each other they can omit the personal
talk and focus on the topic-related issues instead. Good communication
on the task leads to more efficiency by having more iterations of
question-answer-cycles and helps to avoid a doubling of
work. [Belbin (1996)]


### Honesty

Being honest is a prerequisite to being communicative about all aspects
of the work progress including advances but also delays, problems and
failure. The members need to be informed about such issues to help solve
them faster. It may seem easier to deceive others in a virtual
environment but it turns out that in fact email is a more 'honest' media
than most other including telephone and speech. One reason is that
e-mail conversations leave a record and people think twice before
'lying' if it is stored and can be used against them. [Hancock (2012)]


### Trust

Communicating openly will eventually lead to trust among the team.
Trusting the other team members and the quality of their contributions
is a basis for delegating tasks. If they don't trust one another they
might settle for doing the tasks themselves creating doubling and wasted
efforts.


### Skills

Every member needs to contribute at least a basic set of skills to the
team. They must quite naturally be in the specific field of expertise.
Introducing measures for estimating the person's performance can be a
good mean but needs to be applied carefully. Additionally, social skills
matter just as much as the technical ones and are the key to successful
teamwork. [Kawasaki (2007)]


### Praise

Particularly over long projects the team manager must seek to maintain
the motivation of all team members. In order to do this success and
accomplishments of individual team members must be praised. A pat on the
shoulder still remains a great motivator. Having in mind that the
contribution is appreciated can also lead to additional individual
commitment for the project.


### Compromise

Insisting on your own opinion will not contribute to the team's success.
In particular if there are many different fields of expertise present
this will lead to a wide variety of opinions. Before you get stuck in
endless debates you must make a compromise. Find a solution that
everybody can be content with.


## Technology

One of the key aspects of collaboration is technology. A team is only
able to work as good as its software enables it to. This is especially
important for virtual teams as software shapes their very core.
There are three key requirements every software has
to fulfill [Mark Mortensen (2008)]:

1. Simplicity<br>
  The more complex a tool is, the more time your team members will
  need to set it up, learn how to use it and to get started. Time they
  need to get their job done instead of wasting it for configuration,
  integration and incorporation. Besides, more functionality does not
  necessarily mean better interactions. Your tool should get out of
  your way and let you focus on what's really important: the message.
  One might argue that this wasted time can be saved later, due to a
  more powerful tool and therefore a more effective work process.
  However, its likely that you'll see yourself spending more time on
  the correct usage of the software than the actual content. So make
  sure your software does exactly what its supposed to do and does it
  as precisely and simple as possible.

2. Reliability<br>
  One main reason for the ongoing popularity of phone calls in times
  of advanced software tools and apps like Skype and FaceTime is its
  reliability. Though it can not compete in terms of functionality, it
  is without doubt the most unfailing communication tool. The latest
  video conferencing, instant messaging, or screen sharing feature
  won't help you if you're internet connection can (again) not be
  established. Your phone, however, is a reliable and proven
  communication tool that will not let you down easily.

3. Accessibility<br>
  No matter if you're in Africa enhancing your international reach, in
  Antarctica figuring out if this is the place for your next server
  farm or just about anywhere else, you might want to be able to
  contact your team members at any given time. Here again your cell
  phone will serve you well.


## 10 "Must Have" Software Tools

The following list will enumerate the 10 "must have" tools every team
should be using. It covers the fundamental collaboration techniques and
helps your team to gain efficiency. Furthermore, it will give you an
extensive insight on what modern technology is capable of and provides a
good reference point for your custom software solution.

1. Conferencing Software<br>
  The most basic and probably most important type of communication is
  talking to your team members, via phone, the internet or in person.
  To enhance the limited interaction of a phone call one can use
  conferencing software. This is a tool that enables you to talk to
  several people simultaneously. Video conferencing software even
  provides the possibility to see each other face to face and thereby
  provides a more personal setting. Due to further enhancements like
  instant messaging and data transmission this software can satisfy
  large parts of your requirements for collaboration.

2. Screen Sharing<br>
  Closely related to conferencing is screen sharing software.
  Additionally to seeing and hearing your partner you might want to be
  able to see what he's working on right now. Instead of having to
  save and share his progress laboriously he can easily share his
  screen. This enables you to see what he's doing in real time. That
  brings us to our next point.

3. Real time collaboration<br>
  The two previous tools already were examples of real time tools.
  Real time means that you can collaborate simultaneously and
  synchronously on the same task. I.e. it is very useful to work on a
  document simultaneously as you can see what the others are writing
  and you don't have to merge it intricately afterwards. Another
  example is pair programming, which is considered to be extremely
  beneficial.@TC Writing code simultaneously together means that it
  will be high-quality, include knowledge from different domains and
  that the general work atmosphere is much more intense.

4. Version Control<br>
  Version control describes the method of saving your work progress at
  certain points in time. This can be archived by simply using the
  "save as" functionality of your program to capture improvements in
  the documents with snapshots or by using a more sophisticated
  version control system like git. This will even allow you to revert
  documents to an older state, compare different versions, merge them
  or to get detailed insights in the development process. Furthermore
  it servers as your backup utility as you can easily push your
  changes on different servers or to team members to let them inspect
  your work and use your documents and your data.

5. Issue tracking<br>
  To keep track of all the things your team has to do, make sure to
  set up an issue tracking program. It provides a fast and easy
  interface to manage all your tasks. There are several aspects that
  will improve your overview and productivity dramatically.

  1. Assignment<br>
    Assign tasks to certain team members or sub teams to clearly
    divide and define the teams responsibilities and
    accountabilities.

  2. Time Tracking<br>
    Define the deadlines and group the issues to milestones to
    clearly outline your further steps. In addition monitor the
    implementation time of features and by that the efficiency and
    productivity of your team members.

  3. Type Definition<br>
    By specifying the type of your issue, e.g. bug, feature,
    improvement, support, etc. you have a very useful measure of
    your work quality. The number of bugs for example gives insights
    on how accurate the work is done and the number of features is
    an indicator of the innovative capacity of your workforce.

6. Calendar<br>
  As already mentioned it is important to capture your goals and tasks
  for the future. Very handy for this purpose is a globally shared
  calendar. It's the place where all you team mates can store and look
  up what's going on and what will be important in the near future.
  Ideally all your other software tools also have access to this
  calendar so that everything is neatly kept at one place.

7. Human Resource Management<br>
  Another very important aspect of collaboration is that you should
  know exactly who you are working with to be able to choose the best
  for every task. That is why you want to have software to manage all
  your team members. A short profile page will tell what a person has
  been doing before, what expertise he is contributing to the team and
  what his plans and dreams for the future look like. It can even give
  you a quick overview on what that person has already achieved in the
  team and how much time he or she has spent on work. Thereby you can
  more easily delimit performers from non performers and build your
  perfect team with just the right people.

8. Forums<br>
  Conferencing software is great for synchronous communication.
  Sometimes, however, you might not be able to communicate
  synchronously due to time shifts or a general shift in work time.
  Occasionally you will also want to make sure that everything you are
  talking about is written down so that nobody can claim to have said
  something else than he actually did. That's when a forum comes in
  handy. It constitutes a simple but yet effective means to discuss
  different ideas and topics.

9. Wiki<br>
  Wikis are the tool of choice when it comes to any kind of
  documentation. It is the place where you should write down your
  communication guidelines, your style guidelines, software
  documentation or just about anything else that needs to be
  remembered and be accessible for everyone.

10. Monitoring<br>
  In order to keep your team up to date it is very useful to set up a
  central monitoring website. There you can display graphs about
  market share, market penetration, customer satisfaction, visitor
  numbers etc. It can also contain news feeds and widgets to your
  other software tools. This site is very important as it normally is
  your central drop-in center and start screen for your following
  work. Also consider to put up a screen at a central place in your
  office so that everybody can look up the latest numbers with a
  glimpse.

While using the tools it is essential to review your productivity on a
regular basis and if applicable rethink your software setup.

## Our Work as a virtual team

As mentioned during our presentation, we simulated a virtual team
during the creation of this paper and its preceding in-class
presentation. In an initial face-to-face kick-off meeting (as described
above) we defined our toolset: For asynchronous communication we used
Facebook Messenger. We synchronized via Skype as conferencing and screen
sharing tool. Google Documents/Drive was our choice for both
asynchronous and synchronous collaboration during the planning phase for
the presentation and especially in the process of writing this paper. It
also includes version control. Finally, we decided on prezi as a
presentation software, partly for stylistic reasons, but also because of
its real time and collaboration capabilities. We agreed on the English
language as language of communication to emulate an environment of team
members that have to adapt to a non-native language. Our experiences
during the work on this project were very positive in almost all
aspects. Except for the temporary unavailability of the internet
connection for one of us our chosen tools proved reliable and simple to
use. We also felt entirely comfortable about the collaboration via
conferencing and screen sharing. Neither did the result suffer from the
virtual work - we did receive a 1.3 for our presentaion. Nor did we feel
we were missing out the social aspects, since online messaging and
internet calls are as much part of our social life as it was now for the
project related work. This simulation, of course, can only partially
simulate a real virtual team environment - we could not test for
cultural differences or different time zone activity. However, we
believe that virtual interaction - extraordinary and extraordinarily
challenging as it might be perceived today - will eventually become a
commonly seen thing in a corporate environment.


## Conclusion

In conclusion, we find that working in teams can be of substantial
benefit. If in team - be it non-virtual or virtual - members coordinate
individual skills on their interdependent task well, each can maximize
strengths and minimize weaknesses. Especially diversity, professional or
cultural, leads to a multiplication of ideas and opportunities for the
team. Virtual Teams, although profit from the typically very large
diversity of their members, face special conditions and challenges.
These arise from the novel kind of interaction by means of communication
technology as well as the cultural and ethnic differences of its
members. However, these challenges can be overcome if team members
approach their task with the right attitude and with the help of the
technological tools that exists today. Furthermore we find that the
feats required of team members - such as honesty, mutual trust,
commitment, reliability, willingness to compromise - are required of
virtual and non-virtual teams all the same, the difference solely being
the way these are implemented or achieved. Combining these findings with
our own experiences, we are convinced that over time working in virtual
teams will become just as much part of our work environment as the
teamwork perceived as "normal" today.

## Purgatory

We will discuss the different aspects of the interaction in a virtual team and how it differs from the interaction in a co-located team in the following.
