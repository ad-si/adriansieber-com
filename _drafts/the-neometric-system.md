# {{page.title}}

Imagine we started all over

Things we want to quantify:

- Length
- Volume
- Mass
- Time
- Temperature
- Electrical Charge
- Brightness


Procedure to derive units:

Either 2 fix-points and a subdivision or a physical minimum subdivision (i.e. a constant of nature)

How exact can the constants be measured?

1. Find absolute zero
2. Find a value which humans can relate to
  Must be the same for all humans
3. Split and accumulate this value


##  Find zero points

1. Length: 0
1. Weight: 0
1. Temperature: Absolute Zero
1. Time: Big Bang
  Time started only to exist when our clocks where exact enough ->
  Start of the unix epoche


## Relative value

1. Length
  One ten-millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole
1. Weight
  1 m^3 of water
1. Temperature
  Triple point of water
1. Time
  Constant of nature: 1 Day



## Base units

- Day
- Meter
- Gram
- Kelvin
