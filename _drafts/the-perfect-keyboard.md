title: The Perfect Keyboard

# {{page.title}}

A year ago I embarked on a quest to improve the way I type on computer keyboards. Altough I was already a fairly good touch typer, I had accumulated some imperfections in my typing style over the years.
e.g. not properly using the other hand for pressing shift, using the ring finger instead of the pinky for pressing the p key, â€¦

Getting rid of all those bad habits was not easy, but the outcome was quite pleasant. I was able to type faster than ever before and much more effortless.

However, it also revealed all the inherent flaws of the qwerty keyboard.
In order to step up the game I bought myself an ErgoDox EZ a few weeks ago.
Important features for me were:

1. Splitted
2. Ortholinear
3. Fully reprogrammable
4. No hassle, fully assembled kit


## Designing a keyboard Layout

### Assumptions

- Use keyboard without mouse
- One shot layers are always superior
-


### Goals

- Never press 2 keys simultaneously
- Don't move fingers more than one row
- Distinguish between modifier and action keys


### Layers

1. Lowercase letters, whitespace, shortcuts
2. Uppercase letters, function keys
3. Special characters, digits
4. Cursor & mouse movement, media control


## Insights

- Advantages of a combined keyboard are:
  - Distances and angles are always the same (speaks for atrus 62)
  - More portable
