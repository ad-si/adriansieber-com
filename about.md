# {{ page.title }}

I'm Adrian Sieber (as you might have figured out by now…)
and I'm currently an IT-Systems Engineering bachelor student
at the [Hasso Plattner Institut](https://hpi.de) in Potsdam, Germany.

If you're interested in my work make sure to check out my
[GitHub account](https://github.com/adius) as I publish pretty much
everything there.
My main project at the moment, however, is a website for converting 3D-models
to Lego models.
I work on this with 4 fellow students as a part of our bachelor project.
We will soon publish the website and the source code on GitHub.
(Make sure to follow me on GitHub for updates!)

Apart from that I like to make a lot of music.
My main instrument is the Saxophone.
However, recently I only find time to grab my ukulele now and then and
to strum and sing along to my favorite pop/rock songs.<br>
There are even a few (really old) videos on
[youtube](https://youtube.com/LeoMaskMusic).

As sitting in front of the computer the whole day is rather unhealthy
I regularly go jogging and do gymnastics.
In addition I like to go skiing in winter and sailing in summer.


## Organizations

True to the motto "Put your money where your mouth is" I like to join
non profit organizations supporting my beliefs:

- [FSF] - Free Software Foundation.
- [Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V.] - Society for computer science.
- [IBKA e.V.] - International League of non-religious and atheists.
- [Pro Rauchfrei e.V.] - German organization to protect non smokers.
- [The Dozenal Society of America] - Promoting the base 12 number system.
- [Zwanzigeins e.V.] - Fix pronunciation of numbers in German
    (twenty-one instead of one-and-twenty).
