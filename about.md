# {{ page.title }}

I'm Adrian Sieber (as you might have figured out by now…)
and I'm a Software Engineer / Entrepreneur / Author living in Germany, Potsdam.

Currently I'm running the Feram GmbH ([feram.io](https://feram.io)) and
writing a book in which I compare various programming languages
([programmiersprachenbuch.de](http://programmiersprachenbuch.de))

Previously I studied IT-Systems Engineering
at the [Hasso Plattner Institut](https://hpi.de).

If you're interested in my work make sure to check out my projects at
[code.adriansieber.com](https://code.adriansieber.com)
as I publish all my open source work there.


## Hobbies

Apart from work I used to make a lot of music, both electronically
and with traditional instruments like the Saxophone and the Piano.
However, recently I only find time to grab my ukulele now and then and
to strum and sing along to my favorite pop/rock songs.

As sitting in front of the computer the whole day is rather unhealthy
I regularly go jogging and work out in the fitness studio.
In addition I like to go skiing in winter and sailing in summer.
