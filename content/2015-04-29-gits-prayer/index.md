Our origin in the cloud, \
hallowed be your IP \
Your history come, \
your will be pulled, \
on localhost, as it is in the cloud, \
Give us this day our daily commit, \
and forgive us our force pushes, \
as we also have forgiven our merge conflicts. \
And lead us not into temptation, \
but deliver us from SVN
