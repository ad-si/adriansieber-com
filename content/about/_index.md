I'm Adrian Sieber (as you might have figured out by nowâ€¦)
and I'm a software engineer / entrepreneur / author living in Germany.

Currently I'm the CTO of Qthority ([qthority.com])
and writing a book in which I compare various programming languages
([programmiersprachenbuch.de])

Previously I studied IT-Systems Engineering
at the [Hasso Plattner Institut][hpi].

If you're interested in my work, make sure to check out all of my
open source projects at [github.com/ad-si].

## Hobbies

Apart from work I used to make a lot of music, both electronically
and with traditional instruments like Saxophone, Piano, Guitar, and Ukukle.
However, nowadays I barely find the time anymore, but when I do
I prefer my new favorite instrument, the [LinnStrument].

As sitting in front of the computer the whole day is rather unhealthy
I regularly go for a run and work out in the fitness studio.
In addition I like to go skiing in winter and sailing in summer.
